# Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This repository documents my journey of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains various projects and exercises that helped me build a strong foundation in front-end web development.

## Contents

1. **HTML and CSS**

   - Learned the basics of structuring web pages with HTML and styling them using CSS.
   - Built a clone of YouTube's homepage using only HTML and CSS.

2. **JavaScript**
   - Gained an understanding of JavaScript concepts through various projects and exercises.

## Projects and Exercises

### 1. YouTube Homepage Clone

This project is a simple clone of YouTube's homepage built entirely using HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the layout, structure, and basic styles of the YouTube homepage.

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS
- **Project Highlights**:
  - Learned how to structure web pages using HTML elements.
  - Practiced CSS Flexbox and grid to design a responsive layout.

### 2. JavaScript Learning Topics

Below are the key JavaScript topics I covered, with examples and mini-projects for each:

#### 1. Variables and Data Types

- Covered how to declare variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.
- Explored different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, and objects.

#### 2. Operators and Conditional Statements

- Learned about operators: arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.
- Explored if-else conditions and switch-case for decision-making.

#### 3. Loops and Strings

- Mastered loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- Worked on string manipulation using methods like `slice()`, `substring()`, `concat()`, etc.

#### 4. Arrays

- Explored array methods such as `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and more.

#### 5. Functions and Methods

- Learned to create functions and explore function expressions and arrow functions.
- Covered JavaScript methods and how to work with objects.

#### 6. DOM (Document Object Model)

- Practiced manipulating HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Learned methods like `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, `createElement()`, and more to dynamically change page content.

#### 7. Events

- Explored how to handle user interactions using event listeners (`click`, `mouseover`, `keydown`, etc.).

#### 8. Classes & Objects

- Learned object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
- Created classes, constructors, and objects to model real-world entities.

#### 9. Callbacks, Promises & Async/Await

- Explored asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- Used callbacks and promises to handle asynchronous tasks, and refactored code using `async` and `await`.

#### 10. API Fetching using the Currency Converter Project

- Implemented API fetching with JavaScript in my [Currency Converter Project](https://github.com/akshatpandey1903/Currency-Converter).
- Learned how to fetch data from an external API and dynamically display it on the web page.
